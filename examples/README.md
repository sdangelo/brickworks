# Examples

## Premise

Each of these examples consists of a common part of code, shared by all examples, which contains all necessary boilerplate code and is not Brickworks-related, and a specific part which actually implements the audio engine. The common code is copied/generated by an external tool called [Tibia](https://github.com/sdangelo/tibia). If you downloaded an official Brickworks release you don't need to care about any of this - all needed files will already be present -, otherwise you first need to [run Tibia as outlined below](#tibia). You might also want to do that if you need to edit the location of third-party dependencies (this is better explained in the following platform-specific instructions).

Each subfolder contains an example, except the `common` folder, which contains a good deal of common code and common Tibia metadata. In order to build an example just `cd` to <code>*example*/*platform*</code> and use the following platform-specific instructions. Building for any platform requires a recent enough version of [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed.

## VST3

### Prerequisites

Windows (via [MSYS2/Mingw-w64](https://www.msys2.org/)), macOS, and Linux OSes are supported. Building tested with [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), probably also works with [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).

You also need to download or clone the [VST3 C API](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3_c_api) and place it in the same folder as the Brickworks folder, or otherwise edit `common/src/vst3-make.json` then change `cflags` to point to the correct directory and finally [run Tibia](#tibia), or invoke `make` with appropriate `CFLAGS` straight from the command line.

### Build

In order to build just type `make`. You'll find the resulting VST3 directory in <code>build/bw\_example\_*example*.vst3</code>.

### Installation

If all went fine, you can install for the current user (i.e., into the user VST3 folder) by invoking `make install-user` or for all users (i.e., into the system VST3 folder) by `make install`.

## LV2

### Prerequisites

Windows (via [MSYS2/Mingw-w64](https://www.msys2.org/)), macOS, and Linux OSes are supported. Building tested with [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), probably also works with [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).

You also need to download/install [LV2](https://lv2plug.in/), so that either header files are found by the compiler in its default include path, or otherwise you could add an appropriate `cflags` value to `common/src/lv2-make.json` and [run Tibia](#tibia), or invoke `make` with appropriate `CFLAGS` straight from the command line.

### Build

In order to build just type `make`. You'll find the resulting LV2 bundle in <code>build/bw\_example\_*example*.lv2</code>.

### Installation

If all went fine, you can install for the current user (i.e., into the user VST3 folder) by invoking `make install-user` or for all users (i.e., into the system VST3 folder) by `make install`.

## Web

### Prerequisites

You need Clang with WebAssembly target support and [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) installed.

### Build

In order to build just type `make`. You'll find the resulting output directory in `build/web`.

### Running

The output files need to be served over HTTPS. A self-signed certificate is generated in the output directory (hence the OpenSSL requirement) to make it possible to run an HTTPS-enabled web server, e.g. `http-server -S`,  directly on/from the output folder.

## Daisy Seed

### Prerequisites

Building and firmware upload was only tested on Linux. You need [arm-none-eabi-gcc](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) (for building) and [dfu-util](https://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/) (for firmware upload) installed.

You also need to clone/download [libDaisy](https://github.com/electro-smith/libDaisy) (beware that since version 7.0.0 you also need to clone submodules, see the [release notes](https://github.com/electro-smith/libDaisy/releases/tag/v7.0.0)), `cd` to it, and run `make`. You should either place it in the same folder as the Brickworks folder, or otherwise edit `common/src/daisy-seed-make.json` then change `libdaisyDir` to point to the correct directory and finally [run Tibia](#tibia).

### Build

In order to build just type `make`. You'll find the resulting output files in `build`.

### Firmware upload

To upload the firmware:

1. branch the board to the uploading machine via USB;
2. put the board in DFU mode by pressing BOOT, then RESET, then letting go of RESET and then of BOOT;
3. type `make program-dfu`.

Effect examples report output parameter values and CPU usage statistics via USB serial. You can read the output by, e.g., `screen /dev/ttyACM0`.

## Android

### Prerequisites

Android examples are built without the help of Android Studio or Gradle. You'll however need to have a recent enough JDK (we need `javac`), as well as to download the latest stable:

- Android SDK (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) \*;
- Android NDK (https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) \*;
- `.jar`s and `.aar`s (and you'll also need to manually extract the inner `.jar` from each `.aar`, which are just ZIP files) for:
  - AndroidX Core (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.core/core);
  - AndroidX Lifecycle Common (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.lifecycle/lifecycle-common)
  - AndroidX VersionedParcelable (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.versionedparcelable/versionedparcelable)
  - Kotlin Stdlib (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlin/kotlin-stdlib);
  - Koltin Coroutines Core (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlinx/kotlinx-coroutines-core);
  - Koltin Coroutines Core JVM (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlinx/kotlinx-coroutines-core-jvm);
- `miniaudio.h` library (http://miniaud.io/).

Then you'll probably also need to adjust paths and values in `common/src/android-make.json` and [run Tibia](#tibia).

\* You can install both the needed parts of the Android SDK and the NDK by downloading the so-called "command line tools" (https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only) and using the included `sdkmanager` program. In such case you need to install the following packages: "platforms;android-*latest*",  "build-tools;*latest*", "platform-tools", and "ndk;*latest*".

### Build

In order to build just type `make`. You'll find the resulting `.apk` file in `build`.

### Installation

If all went fine, you can branch your device and install using `make install` or otherwise install manually.

### Usage and known issues

Effect examples process audio input signals, therefore they will require permission to use the capture device.

Synth examples use input MIDI and support hotplugging.

## iOS

### Prerequisites

iOS examples are not directly built by the supplied Makefiles. These rather generate the corresponding XCode projects and required files.

For this to work you need to have the latest [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) installed, as well as a copy of the latest [`miniaudio.h`](http://miniaud.io/).

Finally, you might need to adjust header search path for miniaudio in `common/src/ios-make.json`, `common/src/ios-make-cxx-fx.json`, and `common/src/io-make-cxx-synth.json`, and [run Tibia](#tibia).

### Build

Typing `make` will generate the required Xcode project in `build/gen`.

You'll need to open it and select a development team (click on the project root in the left side pane, then choose the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, and finally pick a "Team").

At this point you can build and run as with any other iOS app.

### Usage

Effect examples process audio input signals, therefore they will require permission to use the capture device.

Synth examples use input MIDI and support hotplugging.

## Tibia

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to be installed.

Get [Tibia 0.0.1](https://github.com/sdangelo/tibia/releases/tag/v0.0.1), place it in the same directory as the Brickworks folder, and rename it as `tibia`. Then either `cd` to the Tibia folder and `npm install dot`, or install the [dot npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dot) globally and make sure that the `NODE_PATH` environment variable is corretly set to find it.

Now you can `cd` to the `examples` folder and run `./tibia_gen.sh` to copy/generate files for all examples, or otherwise run `./tibia_gen.sh common` to only copy/generate files in `examples/common` or <code>./tibia\_gen.sh *example*</code> to do the same for files in <code>examples/*example*</code>.

If you want to remove all files copied/generated by Tibia, and thus restore the `examples` directory as it would appear in the official repository, run `./tibia_clean.sh` from the `examples` directory.
